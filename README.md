# EnsemblRESTEndpoint
Ensembl REST Endpoint (in Django)

# Development

Models were automatically generated by importing the Database Schema into Django by using inspectdb after configuring the DATABASE in settings.py:
"python manage.py inspectdb > models.py  "

Django REST Framework was used for generating the REST endpoints

XML and JSON renderers were included for the results.

All queries are capitalized in this code in order to match the "brc" example.  

Searching was done by the "starts with" field lookup in Django.  

Case-insensitive searching could be done by replacing this field lookup by "istarts with" in a production environment, depending on design choices.
